# Skyscanner Flight Search 

This was my first React Hooks project which I built from scratch. I wanted to recreate the Skyscanner functionality, which allows the user to find the price and date of the flight they would like to book. 

**Technologies Used:**

- React Hooks
- HTML
- CSS
- Skyscanner API
- AirportAutocomplete.js
- Jest
- Enzyme
